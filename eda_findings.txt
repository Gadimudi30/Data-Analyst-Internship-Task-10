Key Observations:
- Dataset mainly contains numerical housing-related features.
- Outliers were detected using IQR method.
- Extreme outliers were removed to avoid skewed analysis.
- Correlation analysis shows strong relationships between price and income/area-related features.

Why not remove all outliers?
Some outliers may represent valid high-value houses and can be important for business insights.
