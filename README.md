# Task 10 – Python EDA

In this task, I worked on Exploratory Data Analysis using Python.
I used the USA Housing dataset to understand the data and find outliers.

First, I loaded the dataset and checked basic things like shape, columns, and sample values.
Then I used describe() to see statistics and checked if there were any missing values.

After that, I plotted histograms and boxplots to understand how the data is distributed.
To detect outliers, I used the IQR method and created outlier flags.
Extreme outliers were removed so that the analysis is not affected.

I also checked the correlation between numerical columns.
Finally, I saved the cleaned dataset for further use.

This task helped me understand how to explore data properly and handle outliers using Python.
